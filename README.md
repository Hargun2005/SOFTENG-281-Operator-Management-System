# Operator Management System

This project is a terminal-based application for managing Aotearoa New Zealand activity operators. Developed in Java, it provides a command-line interface (CLI) for administrators to manage operators, their activities, and various types of reviews. The system is designed with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features

- **Operator Management**: Register new operators with a name and location, and search for existing operators.
- **Activity Management**: Create and assign activities to operators, and view or search for activities across the system.
- **Multi-faceted Review System**:
    - Add **Public Reviews** from customers, which can be endorsed by administrators.
    - Add **Private Reviews** for direct feedback to operators, which can be resolved with a response.
    - Add **Expert Reviews** from field specialists, which can include image uploads.
- **Data Aggregation**: Display the top-rated activity for each location, calculated from public and expert reviews.
- **Bilingual Location Support**: Recognizes location names in both English and te reo MƒÅori.

## Object-Oriented Design

This system is built following key OOP principles to ensure a modular, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

- **Encapsulation**: Data for operators, activities, and reviews are encapsulated within their respective classes, with access controlled through public methods. The core logic is managed by the `OperatorManagementSystem` class, which orchestrates interactions between different model objects.

- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: To handle the different types of reviews, an `abstract class` `Review` was created. This base class defines common attributes and methods for all reviews (e.g., review ID, rating, review text).
    - Three concrete subclasses extend `Review`:
        - `PublicReview`: Adds functionality for anonymity and endorsements.
        - `PrivateReview`: Adds fields for customer email and follow-up resolution.
        - `ExpertReview`: Adds fields for recommendations and image uploads.
    - This structure allows the system to treat all reviews polymorphically (e.g., storing them in a single collection) while still being able to invoke type-specific behavior.

- **Class Structure**: Key classes in the design include:
    - `Operator`: Represents an activity operator, holding its details and a list of its activities.
    - `Activity`: Represents an activity, holding its details and a list of its reviews.
    - `Review` (abstract): The base class for all review types.
    - `PublicReview`, `PrivateReview`, `ExpertReview`: Concrete implementations of `Review`.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language for the application logic.
- **Maven**: For project build management, dependency handling, and running the application and tests.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing the application's functionality.
